## About Pei Sen Liang

Pei Sen Liang crafts stories that tear apart reality and stitch it back in strange, compelling ways. From dystopian futures to myth-infused thrillers, his work pushes boundaries and invites you to dive deep into unknown worlds.

As **NobCoder**, he develops indie games that blend narrative depth with engaging mechanics. However, these games were created with Scratch.MIT due to a mental block of not wanting to do real coding.
